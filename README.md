In order to checkout a remote project, you will have to clone its repository first.
	
Open the Eclipse Import wizard (e.g. File => Import), select Git => Projects from Git and click Next. Select “URI” and click Next.
Now you will have to enter the repository’s location and connection data. Entering the URI will automatically fill some fields. Complete any other required fields and hit Next.  
If you use GitHub, you can copy the URI from the web page. 

Select all branches you wish to clone and hit Next again.
